## Found an issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

Please see the submission guidelines below.

## Issue submission guidelines

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

  - Overview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
  - Python Version and Operating System - is this a problem with a specific setup?
  - Reproduce the Error - provide details, if possible, on how to reproduce the error
  - Related Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?
  - Suggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)

## Pull request guidelines

When submitting PRs, please:

- Describe the changes, why they were necessary, etc
- Describe how the changes affect existing behaviour
- Make sure you tested and validated your changes
- Include any relevant screenshots/evidence demonstrating that the changes work and have been tested
- Try to leave the code better than you found it
- Make sure you didn't leave in your code any security hazard, such as an API key.

_Patches submitted in issues, email, or elsewhere may be ignored._
